# FractalArt-rs

This is [this](https://github.com/TomSmeets/FractalArt) "fractal" wallpaper thing, ported to Rust and with significant performance improvements and more configuration.
It is lacking the set-as-wallpaper feature of the original, but it should be possible to put this in a shellscript or something with whatever works on your platform.

## Usage

Compile via `cargo build --release`.
The resulting binary is in `target/release/fractalart`. With no other arguments, it will generate a 1000x1000 image and save it to `out.png`. You can use `-W`/`-H`/`-o` to change that.
The initial seed color can also be configured with `-u` (hue; this will default to a randomly generated one), `-s` and `-l`. The random seed is set with `-r`; if the other parameters are the same, then the same seed will give the same image.
Images generated by this are slightly different to the original program's because of the use of 16-bit integers instead of floats (it might actually be possible to go down to `u8`s without quality problems, but I haven't tried), and also the different default variance (`-v`); the original program hardcodes this to the equivalent of 1573, but I picked 2048, as a rounder number.
